# Introducing RESTful API Development

REST is an industry-standard when it comes to design and development of APIs. Consumption of services of any form has become infinitely simpler with REST. Moreover, it is a standard that falls in well with the ever increasing demand of microservices. And it is a paradigm that is supported well by the Spring Framework. <br />
It offers the following benefits:
- Redirection and forwarding
- Caching
- CRUD operations on data
- Security (encryption and authentication)
