# Sorting

This section involves discussion on the standard algorithms to sort a given sequence of data in any order. Numerically, it is mostly ascending or descending, unless a certain rank is predetermined, in which case we use fancier data structures like a multi-valued linked lists, hashmaps, et cetera. <br/>
Here we include the techniques of numerical sorting.


## Technical Terminologies

- **In-Place Sorting**:
- **Stable Sorting**:


## Selection Sort

- **Overview**: An introductory brute-force algorithm that is extremely slow. It is in-place and can be stable or unstable (depends on )
