# The Java Ecosystem

In this section, an attempt to demystify the whole process of the process in which Java programs get executed no matter what environment they are in.


## Java Ecosystem

From the time of its inception till date, the Java Ecosystem has seen a lot of changes. However, some concepts remain the same. A lot of technology came and a few escaped obsolescence. Those are the ones that are still heeded in the community. This section seeks to shed light on such technologies that might seem quite mysterious and confusing (especially on StackOverflow forums) as well as decode the overall process by which Java actually executes its programs on systems.
