# I Had Too Much of Java

This project is geared towards the practical as well as theoretical exploration of the Java language in depth. Primarily, this is to serve as a checklist of my own knowledge in Java but since the best way to learn is to make something that others may learn from as well, this repository has been made public.
This also deals with certain general problem solving and algorithmic programs that is just for my own reference. Others are welcome to check those out as well, in any case. There are already more complete and better repositories out there that are more famous for the various implementations of algorithms using Java. This repository is more geared to focus on the nuances of the language in general, rather than recreate the same work.
<a href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java">Here</a> is the link for the repository containing Java programs on algorithms.


## Running the Programs

Visual Studio Code with the extension `Language Support for Java (TM) by Red Hat` has been used. I would not know the procedure for executing the files in environments like IntelliJ or Eclipse. Sections for those shall be added if those environments bear certain feasilbility that deems their adoption over the present IDE.
The required dependencies have firstly been installed.
To run the programs:
- From the directory in which the source file is stored:
  `javac fileName.java`
- From the root directory:
  `java packageName.fileName`

The current project structure is not standard at all. The focus is more towards the programs and concepts as of now rather than the overall structure.

## Known Issues

- Refactor on the basis on keyword and brackets separation.
- Refactor on the basis of Java array [] convention.
- Order imports.
- Apply join() for every multithreading program.
- Folder renaming.
- Document everything.
- Correct grammar of *its* and *it's*.
- Apply backticks for every Java proper noun.
- Change *calling* to *invoking*.


## Contributions

- In case any anomalies are found either in the wording or grammar of the README.md files or in any logic of any of the programs that might prompt missing of edge-cases, reports in form of issues would be greatly appreciated.
- Comments in the programs are sparingly used because, as Uncle Robert would say, comments are just an excuse to pass on poorly-written code. Sufficiently comprehensive variable names have been taken in most cases and thus comments should never be an issue.
